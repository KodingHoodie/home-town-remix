🏡 HomeTown Remix

This was my final project for a Scrimba course. We got a basic template and were asked to make a homepage for our hometown. I gave it my own twist with custom styles and layout tweaks while practicing HTML and CSS..

🙌 Why This Matters
This project shows how even small tweaks can make a huge difference. Remixing a simple project into a clean, visually appealing design reinforces fundamental HTML/CSS skills while giving me confidence to keep building and iterating.
