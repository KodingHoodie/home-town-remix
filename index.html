                <h2><span>Your guide</span></h2>
                 <p>Baguio was home for 25 years. I grew up there, went to school, worked, made friends, and found comfort in its foggy mornings and pine-scented air. Every street has a memory, from walking up and down Session Road, spending hours at SM just wandering and checking out pretty chicks, to late night drinking and food runs. I‚Äôve moved on now, but Baguio will always be a part of me. It‚Äôs not just where I lived. It‚Äôs where I became myself.</p>
